# Railway Reservation System - A Windows Forms Application

## About the App

The Railway Reservation System is a robust Windows Forms application developed using C# and MySQL. Inspired by the services of Via Rail Canada, this application aims to simplify train ticket booking and management processes. Users can search for train schedules, check seat availability, and conveniently book their tickets. The application provides administrators with advanced functionalities, such as creating trips, managing bookings, and facilitating communication with users. Guests can view available trips but are required to log in to proceed with booking tickets. Additional features, including popup notifications and ticket printing, further enhance the user experience and convenience. However, it is important to note that the Railway Reservation System may experience longer loading times and potential crashes in scenarios where there is no internet connection.
